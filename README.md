## A Simple Countdown Timer in Javascript

This is my first project using Javascript, it was learned in 
Colt Steele's "The Modern Javascript Bootcamp 2020" course.

It is a very basic countdown timer where a user can enter in the amount
of time in seconds, click the play icon and the counter ticks down showing
milliseconds and seconds remaining until the counter finishes counting down.

What I learned from this project was simple animations in Javascript, using 
an event based architecture and the use of classes with using a DOM centric approach to saving the times.
